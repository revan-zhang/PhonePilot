# Pre-commit Validation Checks

After completing **all** code changes, you **MUST** run validation scripts to ensure code quality.

## Required Commands

```bash
yarn lint
yarn typecheck
```

## Workflow

1. Complete all file modifications
2. Run `yarn lint` - fix any ESLint errors
3. Run `yarn typecheck` - fix any TypeScript errors
4. Only consider the task complete when both pass with no errors

## Fix Strategy

- For lint errors: Run `yarn lint:fix` for auto-fixable issues
- For type errors: Review and fix manually
- Do not ignore or suppress errors without explicit user approval
